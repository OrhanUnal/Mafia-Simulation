Input System Package - Demo Instructions

Note: If you're using the evaluation version, it's precompiled with support 
for the legacy Input Manager (Old) for compatibility with users on older 
Unity versions so you must set Edit > Project Settings > Player Settings >
Other Settings > Active Input Handling to Both or Input Manager (Old).
Once you update to the full Asset Store version, you'll be able to switch
to Input System Package (New).

To make the demo work with Unity's optional new Input System package:

1. Use the Package Manager window to install the new Input System.

2. Select menu item Tools > Pixel Crushers > Dialogue System > Welcome Window.
   Tick the USE_NEW_INPUT checkbox.
   
3. Open DemoScene1. 
   - Inspect EventSystem. Click the button to update it for the Input System.
   - Locate the Text Field UI in the Computer Standard Dialogue UI, located
     in the Terminal GameObject's hierarchy. Change the Accept Key to None.
   - Inspect the child InputField. Configure the OnEndEdit() UnityEvent to
     call the Text Field UI's StandardUIInputField.AcceptTextInput.

4. Open DemoScene2. Update the EventSystem.

The demo's Dialogue Manager prefab has an Input System Registry script that registers
input actions with the Dialogue System's Input Device Manager as described in the PDF
Plugins / Pixel Crushers / Common / Documentation / Input_Device_Manager_Manual.pdf.
Due to a bug in the Input System package, the input actions are assigned in the 
instances of the Dialogue Manager in DemoScene1 & DemoScene2, not in the prefab.
